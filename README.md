# Synthesis_NER
### The model is used to classify the synthesis method and extract products and precursors from published synthesis procedures.
### python>=3.9
### Libraries requested: accelerate==0.21.0 peft==0.4.0 bitsandbytes==0.40.2 transformers==4.31.0 trl==0.4.7
### The model is trained with only 80 published synthesis procedures. A larger dataset and more careful parameter optimization are needed for practical application.
### The code is inspired by Muhammad Moin's tutorial on fine-tuning llama2. Sincere thanks to him here!
