# Synthesis_NER
### The model is used to classify the synthesis method and extract products and precursors from published synthesis procedures.
### The model is trained with only 80 published synthesis procedures. A larger dataset and more careful parameter optimization are needed for practical application.
### The code is inspired by Muhammad Moin's tutorial on fine-tuning llama2. Sincere thanks to him here!
